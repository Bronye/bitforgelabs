            <h2>Our Story: Forging a Path for Innovation</h2>
            <p>BitForge was founded on the belief that local problems are best solved by local minds, equipped with the right tools and knowledge. Our journey began with a simple observation: a wealth of untapped talent existed within Nigerian communities, yet access to practical electronics education and prototyping resources was a significant barrier. We envisioned a future where creativity wasn't limited by resource scarcity, but fueled by communal access and forward-thinking training.</p>
            <p>From a driving spark, BitForge is growing, driven by a passion to bridge this digital divide and nuture the next generation. We started with mini workshops, gradually expanding our reach through strategic partnerships. Each step has been guided by our commitment to hands-on learning, inclusivity, and the drive to build a generation of innovators who can create indigenous solutions. We've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of empowering individuals to not just consume technology, but to create it.</p>
            <p>As we look to the future, the BitForge story continues to unfold. We are constantly evolving our curriculum, expanding our network, and will build state-of-the-art facilities like our envisioned collaborative lab, all to ensure that the next wave of African tech leaders who come through us has every opportunity to leave their indelible mark on the world.</p>
