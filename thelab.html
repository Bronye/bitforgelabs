Once you gain access, the lab becomes your playground of possibilities. Users are allocated time slots for dedicated project work, and enrolled students also have seamless access during their classes.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--color-light-text);">The philosophy is simple: every part, every kit, every tool is communally owned and available for your use. Just like an "Airbnb for parts," you're empowered to utilize any resource needed for your project. We simply ask that you maintain the collaborative spirit by thoroughly cleaning your workspace and returning all items to their designated places, ready for the next innovator. This ensures a sustainable, resource-rich environment for everyone.</p>
