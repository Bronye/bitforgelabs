            <h2>Our Story: Forging a Path for Innovation</h2>
            <p>BitForge was founded on the belief that local problems are best solved by local minds, equipped with the right tools and knowledge. Our journey began with a simple observation: a wealth of untapped talent existed within Nigerian communities, yet access to practical electronics education and prototyping resources was a significant barrier. We envisioned a future where creativity wasn't limited by resource scarcity, but fueled by communal access and forward-thinking training.</p>
            <p>From humble beginnings, BitForge has grown, driven by a passion to bridge this digital divide. We started with focused workshops, gradually expanding our reach through strategic partnerships with schools and community centers. Each step has been guided by our commitment to hands-on learning, inclusivity, and fostering a generation of innovators who can build indigenous solutions. We've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of empowering individuals to not just consume technology, but to create it.</p>
            <p>As we look to the future, the BitForge story continues to unfold. We are constantly evolving our curriculum, expanding our network, and building state-of-the-art facilities like our collaborative lab, all to ensure that the next wave of African tech leaders has every opportunity to leave their indelible mark on the world.</p>

                <h2>Collaborative Prototyping & Nurtured Ownership</h2>
                <p>The BitForge Lab is a place where ideas come to life. While we foster a deeply collaborative environment, we also respect individual ingenuity. Any project or product birthed or worked on within our lab is primarily owned by its original creator(s). BitForge will retain a small stake – a tiny cut (money of it's a job, or shares if it's a product) – reflecting our investment in providing the space, tools, and supportive ecosystem that enabled your creation. This model ensures mutual benefit and encourages bold, entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
